## Optimizing images

By default Next starter comes with a simple image loader. It's using [next-images](https://github.com/twopluszero/next-images) and exclude the svg folder to be able to work with [next-react-svg](https://github.com/jeremybarbet/next-react-svg). Even though, if you want to optimize images, or create multiples sizes for responsive design or for blur loading effect we would recomment you using [next-optimized-images](https://github.com/cyrilwanner/next-optimized-images).
